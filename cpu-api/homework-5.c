/**
 * Created by Gregor KÃ¶hler on 1/17/24.
 *
 * Now write a program that uses wait() to wait for the child process to
 * finish in the parent.  What does wait() return?  What happens if you use
 * wait in the child?
 *
 * Waiting in child fails; it has no children processes.  It also seems to
 * move back to the parent process because the parent log happens before the
 * wait-failed log.
