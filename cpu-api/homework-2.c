/**
 * Write a program that opens a file (with the `open()` system call) and
 * then calls `fork()` to create a new process.  Can both the child and the
 * parent access the file descriptor returned by `open()`?  What happens to
 * the when they are writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same
 * time?
 */

/**
 * Child and parent can both access the open file descriptor
 * Writing at the same time means both write to the file; order would be
 * non-deterministic unless the parent waits on the child.
