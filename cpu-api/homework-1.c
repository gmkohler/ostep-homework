/**
 * Write a program that calls `fork()`.  Before calling `fork()`, have the
 *  main process access a variable (e.g., `x`) and set its value to
 *  something (e.g., `100`).  What value is the variable in the child
 *  process?  What happens to the variable when both the child and parent
 *  change the value of x?
